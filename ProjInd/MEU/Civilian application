Rules & Guidelines-

Can you please link the rules and tell us what you think is good or bad about them. https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?threads/nopixel-official-rules-guidelines.104748/ I think they are good,straight foward and not too hardcore. I like how MetaGaming, PowerGaming and RDM are not allowed because on my previous experiences in RP was on ArmA 2 and there was none of this except sometimes rdm but people didn't really care because it wasn't whitelisted.
