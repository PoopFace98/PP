Rules & Guidelines-

Can you please link the rules and tell us what you think is good or bad about them. https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?threads/nopixel-official-rules-guidelines.104748/ I think they are good,straight foward and not too hardcore. I like how MetaGaming, PowerGaming and RDM are not allowed because on my previous experiences in RP was on ArmA 2 and there was none of this except sometimes rdm but people didn't really care because it wasn't whitelisted.
What is your definition of roleplay? To roleplay is the act of speaking and acting as someone else and live that character. Forget everything you know from real life and feel and live like your character.
What type of characters have you roleplayed before? I roleplayed civilians(Arma2,arma3), i tried police and EMS but only on Arma2, and criminal(arma2, 3).
What type of characters do you intend to roleplay? Italian descendence man born in Portugal but soon moved to Italy to work with is uncle, later finds what kind of business his uncle was running, he finds out he's uncle is a italian mafia's underboss. In the beginning he doesn't like the idea of living a life of crime but with his uncle by his side teaching everything he needed to know to survive in this underworld. Soon he starts to enjoy it and going fast up on the mafia ranks, he starts as a soldati, but once he reaches the capo not everyone is kin on this fast growth because for others wasnt so easy.
So after two years of being in the mafia your uncle is murdered and you are being framed of it because they say you are hungry for power and you wanted to take his place, but after you investigate you find out it was another capo who took advantage of the others jellousy however now its too late as the Don already started a manhunt after him. So he had no choice but to leave on the first flight which was to Los Santos without any belogings because the mafia was already scouting the house and everything in his name.

Situational Questions-
Please answer all of these questions in character - using the information you have provided above.​

What are your plans for your first day in Los Santos? As i get to Los Santos i will call a cab and probably ask some questions to driver to know where is the best italian restaurant in town. Through food is the best to way to remember my family. After, when i undo my lugagge in the motel i rented i will see around some job to make money on the start just to live out but i don't have intention of having a normal job with a shitty pay. What i need is to know the criminal activity because thats where the sweet money comes from but i will leave that for another day.
The cops have pulled you over in a case of mistaken identity. What do you do? If i dont have warrants i would stop, explain that they have the wrong person and show my id and everything necessary to resolve the situation. If i have warrants on me, i will get the fuck out of there faster than a lightning.
You are robbing a store. Inside the store is the owner and a civilian. Both individuals are begging you not to rob or hurt them. How would you roleplay this situation and what actions would you take? As i enter the store i would point my gun at both say that im not there to hurt them but i would not hesitate to do it if needed, take their phones and put the civilian in the storage room as he's unnecessary trouble, then i would demand the owner to give me all the money in the register. If he complied i would just take the money and leave as fast as i can. If he didn't i would smack him in the back of the head and take the money myself.
A stranger comes up to you and says he needs another person for a “big job” in town. How do you react and what do you do? I would decline because this kinda of jobs needs people to know each other and trust each other because of the risk and pressure involved. I would never trust my life in someone i don't know.
You are repairing your car and someone pulls up behind you with their gun drawn. They tell you to drop you stuff and handover your keys. What would you say and do in this situation? I wouldn't have much choice but to comply with him and lose my car. Probably later i could find it and him too and get him what he deserves.
You have been involved in a crime with a group of known individuals; the officer offers you less time if you give up information on your group members; what would you do / how would you react? If i was working with them it means i trust them i would never rat on my friends or associates. I do my time but never rat even if its lifetime.
You’ve found what looks like a random car in the street with a load of drugs inside. What do you do and why? First i would scout around as it could be a police trap, then i would see if any suspicious activity was going on the premises and if everything was clear i would steal because i already know how the business works from experience.
It’s just another day for you as a tow truck driver. You roll up to a job, only to see the person who called you, is holding an EMS hostage. The driver seems erratic and volatile. What do you do? As i get there i would try to calm him down and ask why he was doing that. I would offer myself in exchange of the ems because he has an important role in society and because if he needed a tow i would have to go with him anyway so the ems wouldn't be necessary and weighing him down anyways.
You’ve gotten yourself into a situation – you owe a gang $5000 which you must pay back within a few hours. What could be a legal way to get this money in a pinch? Ask a friend if i have one with that kinda of cash. Check my savings. If not i would just gamnle hoping i would win the money because i wouldn't be able to get that much money legally in a few hours. Gamble and maybe win its better odds of surviving than not having the money. If i lost all my money gambling i would just leave town until it cooled down.
You've been selling drugs on another gangs turf and they find you. How would your character react to this and deal with the situation? I would say sorry and because i know how this organizations work i would pay a compensation try to get a future partnership as we had in Italy with other mob families. If this didn't work i guess i would have to pop them, bounce and never come back there.
